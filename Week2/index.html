      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>Copper mountain is located in Summit County, Colorado, 75 miles west of Denver. Copper</p>
      <p>stands only a few miles away from other well-known resorts, <a href="https://www.breckenridge.com/">Breckenridge</a> and <a href="https://www.vail.com/">Vail Mountain</a>.</p>
      <p>Thus, making Summit County one of the ski capitals of the country. The drive from Denver is only </p>
      <p>about an hour and a half long, and the scenery along I-70 is an experience in itself.</p>
