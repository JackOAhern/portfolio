      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Jack Ahern. My pronouns are he/him/his. I am from</p>
      <p>Philadelphia, PA, and love to ski. Boulder has been an amazing place</p>
      <p>for me to continue my education and explore the amazing mountains </p>
      <p>of the west. I am new to web development, but am super excited to </p>
      <p>begin my journey. </p>
      <br>

      <h1>Goals for this course</h1>
      <p>I am interested in UX/UI job positions, so I want to have web </p>
      <p>development knowledge to complinment my work as a designer. </p>
      <p>At the same time, you never really know where your future may lead, </p>
      <p>and web-development could end up being a career for me. I love </p>
      <p>the idea of designing websites and hope we do some cool projects </p>
      <p>this semester. I know that coding is all about practice, so my goal</p>
      <p>is to code a little bit each day during the week. I have friends who</p>
      <p>are into coding for fun nowadays, and would love to share that passion.</p>
      <p>Web development is by far the most enticing area of coding to me. </p>
